## Summary

Nothing super fancy. More reading. More problem-solving. There are two published articles too:

* [React Rant (+ Should I Be a Backend Dev?)](https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/react-rant-should-i-be-a-backend-dev)
    
* [Two Months of Clojure](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/two-months-of-clojure)
    

## Day 51 / 10 Sep

* Finished reading chapter 10 in [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/), which was about atoms, refs, and vars. I guess the collective name for them is reference, and they're mostly about managing (modifiable) state in Clojure, especially in light of concurrency.
