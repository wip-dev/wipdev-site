## Halfway Through!

I made it through 50 consecutive days of learning Clojure and writing blog articles! In the last 10 days, I solved a lot of problems and published two articles:

* [Standard Library](/posts/standard-library.html)
    
* [Why I Like Functional Programming](/posts/why-i-like-functional-programming.html)
    

But the crowning achievement for these 10 days and the whole half of the challenge is taking the first step in actual backend development with Clojure and spinning up my first web server with a basic router.

## Day 41 / 31 Aug

Read a bit about atoms, watches, and validators in chapter 10 of [Clojure for The Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) book. Also solved a couple of exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

## Day 42 / 1 Sep

Solved some problems on [4clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/). Now, I completed all the "elementary" problems there (there are also "easy," "medium," and "hard").

## Day 43 / 2 Sep

I decided to break the routine and started looking around for Clojure web libraries, and I found a nice guide for building an app starting from a barebones web server and building incrementally. Also solved a couple of problems.

## Day 44 / 3 Sep

Solved a decent amount of problems, read a bit in chapter 10 of the book, and wrote a bit in an incomplete article draft.

## Day 45 / 4 Sep

More problem-solving!

## Day 46 / 5 Sep

Read a bit in chapter 10 of the book. That took too many days already!

## Day 47 / 6 Sep

Finished the web server guide and solved some problems. Also continued writing in an article draft.

## Day 48 / 7 Sep

Published [Standard Library](/posts/standard-library.html) and improved my own blog a little by adding a navbar and improving the mobile responsiveness.

## Day 49 / 8 Sep

Started to delve into server-side web development with Clojure and learned a bit about the Ring HTTP server library. Also, wrote a little in an article draft.

## Day 50 / 9 Sep

Built a very simple server with routing set up. I'm officially in backend-land for the first time! Also, solved a couple of problems and [Why I Like Functional Programming](/posts/why-i-like-functional-programming.html).
