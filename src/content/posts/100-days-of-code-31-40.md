## Summary

Nothing super glamorous in these 10 days. Only some grinding, more practice with Clojure, and 3 blog posts:

* [Testing a JavaScript "Random Sampler"](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/testing-a-javascript-random-sampler)
    
* [TypeScript: a Beginner's Perspective](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/typescript-a-beginners-perspective)
    
* [Jack of All Trades](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/jack-of-all-trades)
    

## Day 31 / Aug 21

Solved an Exercism problem. It was relatively challenging since it was my first interaction with BigInts in Clojure (or Java in this case). I also laid out some drafts for future writing.

## Day 32 / Aug 22

Solved two exercises and started chapter 9 of the book. Also wrote an article: [Testing a JavaScript "Random Sampler"](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/testing-a-javascript-random-sampler)

## Day 33 / Aug 23

Started writing an article draft about TypeScript.

## Day 34 / Aug 24

That was a rather productive day. I read a bit in chapter 9 of the book, solved two Exercism problems, wrote in an article draft, and stumbled upon [4clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/) which contains a set of exercises that are a bit shorter and simpler than Exercism - more practice!

## Day 35 / Aug 25

Published [TypeScript: a Beginner's Perspective](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/typescript-a-beginners-perspective) and solved some problems in Exercism and 4clojure.

## Day 36 / Aug 26

Finished chapter 9 in the book and solved some problems. Thinking of starting another project in Clojure.

## Day 37 / Aug 27

Read a bit in chapter 10. Things are getting a bit interesting, since now I'm in the part of the book that talks about things that are new to me. I also did some exercises at 4clojure.

## Day 38 / Aug 28

Started writing a new blog article. This is the first time I have created a cover for an article instead of getting one online. I also solved some problems.

## Day 39 / Aug 29

This day was completely focused on solving problems. I did more than I usually do, but nothing else.

## Day 40 / Aug 30

Completed and published [Jack of All Trades](https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/jack-of-all-trades).
