## First Month Reflection

With these 10 days passing, I am now done with a full month! I was able to stay at it every day of the 30.

I got a bit more familiar with the Clojure standard library, made [my own separate site](https://wipdev.netlify.app/) with it, and started dabbling with macros, which is the newest thing to me so far. I am getting more and more fascinated with Clojure in terms of its standard library - it lets you do so much with just functions and simple data structures, and you do it in a really concise and elegant way. Also, I am keeping a steady rate of writing articles.

Where am I going with this? I have no idea. Maybe I'll overthink about it in a future blog.

## Day 21 / 11 Aug

I will try to develop a blog using Clojure. So, I started to search around for a Clojure-based static site generator. My current decision is to start with something minimal, which is just a Markdown parser instead of a full SSG boilerplate. I'll write the base HTML and CSS myself and use Clojure to convert Markdown to HTML. I'll also use ClojureScript if I need any JS (I may not).

I also started writing an article draft.

## Day 22 / 12 Aug

Read chapter 7 in the [book](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/). Also, laid the foundation for my blog and wrote a little in an article draft.

## Day 23 / 13 Aug

Started reading chapter 8 in the book. Then, I started writing some Clojure for the blog. I discovered some limitations in the raw Markdown parsing approach and start gradually patching them up.

## Day 24 / 14 Aug

My blog is now almost complete! I successfully migrated the completed blog articles on Hashnode to the Clojure project. I also added articles from my old blogs and did the necessary editing to be compatible with the Markdown parser.

## Day 25 / 15 Aug

I completed and published a Clojure vs JS article: [Functional Programming](https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/functional-programming) and made a near-complete version of my blog.

## Day 26 / 16 Aug

Worked more on the blog to make it more presentable in terms of the home page and content listing. It is now hosted at [https://wipdev.netlify.app/](https://wipdev.netlify.app/)

## Day 27 / 17 Aug

There were some minor content edits I needed to do on the blog's home page. I also got back to reading the book because I left it for a couple of days now.

## Day 28 / 18 Aug

I started writing a new blog article. Then, I discovered [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), which seems like a nice place to practice Clojure. So, I did a couple of them.

## Day 29 / 19 Aug

Completed and published [Collaboration on GitHub: a Practical Intro](https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/collaboration-on-github). Also, I did some problems in Exercism.

## Day 30 / 20 Aug

Finished chapter 8 of the book and did a problem in Exercism.
