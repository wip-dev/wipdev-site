## Summary

I dug a little deeper into Clojure(Script), and I wrote 2 blog posts, but the crowning achievement of these 10 days was the successful building and deployment of my first SPA with ClojureScript! (That's the one in the cover image above.)

## Day 11 / Aug 1

Finished chapter 4 in [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/). There was a fun part at the end where I wrote a simple CSV parser with some exercises to add some functionality to it. Cool stuff!

## Day 12 / Aug 2

Started chapter 5 of the book, which discusses the functional programming paradigm in more detail. Also, someone pointed me to a great source of documentation and a cheatsheet with links to that documentation. Things there are searchable in many ways and have lots of examples. A very cool discovery indeed!

Also, I started writing drafts for two articles.

## Day 13 / Aug 3

Wrote a new overthinking article: [Dependencyphobia](https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/dependencyphobia). Also messed around with random Clojure stuff.

## Day 14 / Aug 4

Watched a couple of videos in the [Poetry of Programming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI-mrGTUXmHXeKhy6UGdDxIKwM8L4MTbq) playlist where I learned about some new Clojure functions.

## Day 15 / Aug 5

Finished chapter 5 of the book. Exercises at the end are great as always! Then, I jumped into chapter 6 and read a little bit. I also watched a couple of videos in the Poetry of Programming playlist. Almost done with that one.

## Day 16 / Aug 6

Completed the Poetry of Programming playlist. Also, glanced through the book version of it as a kind of revision. It was a great overview of the basics of Clojure and functional programming.

## Day 17 / Aug 7

I finally did it... My first Clojure app! It's a very simple SPA built with ClojureScript and Helix which is a React wrapper. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/wip-dev/hello-cljs/) or the deployed site [here](https://hello-cljs.netlify.app/).

## Day 18 / Aug 8

I have left writing for a couple of days now, so I got back to it and started drafting an article.

## Day 19 / Aug 9

Completed and published an article: [**Programmers Are Rational â€” or Are They?**](https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/programmers-are-rational) Also, read a little in the book.

## Day 20 / Aug 10

Finished chapter 6 in the book.
