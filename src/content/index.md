## About Me

I'm Waseem!

My education background was in phramacy, but I always found myself more into math and computers than the typical pharmaceutical sciences. So, I decided to pursue a career in biostatistics, and after learning for some time, I managed to get a job. I have been working as a biostatistician for 4 years with R as my main tool.

Over time, I learned other data science tools like Python, SAS, SQL, and Tableau. After a while, I started learning about the web technologies applied in data science and visualization fields, which gradually got me into frontend development and JavaScript in particular. Now I use the web platform to empower myself as a biostatistician and empower my company with data products and deliverables as well.

I am quite fond of programming itself as an art and science, not just a means to an end. So, I explore as much in that world as I can. Right now, besides my work with R and JS, I have some special interest in functional programming and Clojure in particular.
