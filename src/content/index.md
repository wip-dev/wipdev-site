## About Me

I'm Waseem! I write code at [https://github.com/wip-dev](https://github.com/wip-dev)

My education background was in phramacy, but I always found myself more into math and computers than the typical pharmaceutical sciences. I discovered that I could combine by background and interests by starting a career in biostatistics. So, I pursued that career and, after a period of self-learning, managed to get a job. I have been working as a biostatistician for 4 years with R - a programming language - as my main tool.

Over time, I learned other data science tools like Python, SAS, SQL, and Tableau, and after a while, I started learning about the web technologies applied in data science and visualization fields, which gradually got me into frontend development and JavaScript. Now I use the web platform to empower myself as a biostatistician and empower my company with data products and deliverables as well.

I am quite fond of programming itself as an art and science, not just a means to an end. So, I explore as much in that world as I can. Right now, besides my work with R and JS, I have some special interest in functional programming and Clojure in particular. Who knows what will happen next?
