My interests are around frontend web development, functional programming, statistics, and data visualization.</p><p><a href='/posts'>Browse articles</a></p><h2>About Me</h2><p>I'm Waseem! I write code at <a href='https://github.com/wipdev-tech'>https://github.com/wipdev-tech</a></p><p>My education background was in pharmacy, but I always found myself more into math and computers than the typical pharmaceutical sciences. I discovered that I could combine by background and interests by starting a career in biostatistics. So, I pursued that career and, after a period of self-learning, managed to get a job. I have been working as a biostatistician for 4 years with R - a programming language - as my main tool.</p><p>Over time, I learned other data science tools like Python, SAS, SQL, and Tableau, and after a while, I started learning about the web technologies applied in data science and visualization fields, which gradually got me into frontend development and JavaScript. Now I use the web platform to empower myself as a biostatistician and empower my company with data products and deliverables as well.</p><p>I am quite fond of programming itself as an art and science, not just a means to an end. So, I explore as much in that world as I can. Right now, besides my work with R and JS, I have some special interest in functional programming and Clojure in particular. Who knows what will happen next?</p></main><aside><pre id="logo"><code>(wipdev-blog)</code></pre><ul><li><a href="/">Home/About</a></li><li><a href="/posts">Articles</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/wipdev-tech" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li></ul></aside><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
