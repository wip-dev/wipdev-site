If you build apps with too many assumptions in mind, the user might not share these assumptions, and that would lead to bugs. I try to keep this in mind while making Shiny apps.</p><p>In this project demo, I will explain this app I built for t-tests in some detail to demonstrate its features and flexibility as well as areas of improvement that I intend to work on in my Shiny journey.</p><p>The app took more than one iteration. You can check out the latest version both as GitHub code and live demo from the links below:</p><ul><li>App (shinyapps.io): https://waseem-medhat.shinyapps.io/shiny-t-test/</li><li>Code (GitHub): https://github.com/waseem-medhat/shiny-t-test</li></ul><h2>Iteration 1</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/H8wXloD.gif" alt="shiny t-test" /></p><h3>Feature overview</h3><p>The following points are the features and ideas I took into consideration while making the app:</p><ul><li>The user uploads his/her own CSV data for analysis.</li><li>Data (of interest for the test) could be long or wide<ul><li>Parts of the UI which are responsible for variable selection should    adapt to that fact.</li><li>An explanation of what long and wide formats are should be provided to    users in a helper tool.</li><li>In the case of long data, a warning message will be displayed to the user    if the chosen independent/grouping variable is not binary.</li></ul></li><li>There are checkboxes that directly correspond to the <code>paired=</code> and  <code>var.equal=</code> arguments of the <code>t.test&#40;&#41;</code> function.</li><li>The analysis does not start as a direct reaction of changing the parameters,  but after pressing a "Start" button.<ul><li>The button is shown only when the user has set all parameters to prevent starting the test without specifying variable names.</li></ul></li><li>The output of the analysis includes simple descriptive analysis of each  sample followed by the output of the test itself.</li></ul><h3>Purpose</h3><p>The ultimate purpose of this app is nothing more than my own Shiny training. I simply wanted to build a functional app, and I consider this a first step towards more complex projects that might actually solve a more "tangible" problem.</p><p>However, I might argue that a long-vs-wide data feature is an interesting one because it is usually not available in GUI-based statistical packages like SPSS. When you perform a t-test (or any test in general), the program usually expect one of the two forms. I know that in SPSS, the independent t-test expects long data and the paired t-test expects wide data.</p><h3>Potential improvements</h3><ul><li><strong>Expanded EDA section</strong>: no test should ever be jumped to without a decent amount  of exploration, more than seeing a histogram and the mean.</li><li><strong>Assumption-checking</strong>: again, no test should ever be done without  checking assumptions. Tests of normality (e.g. KS, Shapiro) or equal  variances (e.g. Levene) could be added.</li><li><strong>The UI</strong>: I know how to work with the UI beyond this simple and common  sidebar layout. I could use more Bootstrap features or throw a theme on  top. But my goal here was making something functional, not pretty.</li></ul><h2>Iteration 2</h2><p>This one builds further upon the previously written code. It addresses some of the points mentioned earlier and adds some more.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ghIrutv.gif" alt="better shiny t-test" /></p><h3>Added features</h3><ul><li>Customizing the UI was the main focus of this version.<ul><li>I used the tabbed layout provided by the <code>shinydashboard</code> package coupled    with a dark theme from the <code>dashboardthemes</code> package.</li><li>UI elements are visually separated by boxes.</li><li>Warning alerts UI is improved.</li></ul></li><li>Added support for SPSS data files.</li><li>The table is displayed after uploading and reading it to serve as a visual  confirmation that the data have been read properly.</li><li>Exploratory plots are customizable by the user to toggle the dashed mean  line or the density curve.</li></ul><h3>Potential improvements</h3><ul><li><strong>Assumption-checking</strong>: this is one of the points I mentioned about  iteration 1 but didn't address.</li><li><strong>Improving the code</strong>: I am still experimenting with coding style when it  comes to separating it into scripts and writing functions. Also, I am  looking forward to using Shiny modules, so I might refactor the app to use  them.</li></ul></article><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
