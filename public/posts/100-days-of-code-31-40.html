Only some grinding, more practice with Clojure, and 3 blog posts:</p><ul><li><a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/testing-a-javascript-random-sampler'>Testing a JavaScript "Random Sampler"</a>    </li><li><a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/typescript-a-beginners-perspective'>TypeScript: a Beginner's Perspective</a>    </li><li><a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/jack-of-all-trades'>Jack of All Trades</a>    </li></ul><h2>Day 31 / Aug 21</h2><p>Solved an Exercism problem. It was relatively challenging since it was my first interaction with BigInts in Clojure (or Java in this case). I also laid out some drafts for future writing.</p><h2>Day 32 / Aug 22</h2><p>Solved two exercises and started chapter 9 of the book. Also wrote an article: <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/testing-a-javascript-random-sampler'>Testing a JavaScript "Random Sampler"</a></p><h2>Day 33 / Aug 23</h2><p>Started writing an article draft about TypeScript.</p><h2>Day 34 / Aug 24</h2><p>That was a rather productive day. I read a bit in chapter 9 of the book, solved two Exercism problems, wrote in an article draft, and stumbled upon <a href='https://4clojure.oxal.org/'>4clojure</a> which contains a set of exercises that are a bit shorter and simpler than Exercism - more practice!</p><h2>Day 35 / Aug 25</h2><p>Published <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/typescript-a-beginners-perspective'>TypeScript: a Beginner's Perspective</a> and solved some problems in Exercism and 4clojure.</p><h2>Day 36 / Aug 26</h2><p>Finished chapter 9 in the book and solved some problems. Thinking of starting another project in Clojure.</p><h2>Day 37 / Aug 27</h2><p>Read a bit in chapter 10. Things are getting a bit interesting, since now I'm in the part of the book that talks about things that are new to me. I also did some exercises at 4clojure.</p><h2>Day 38 / Aug 28</h2><p>Started writing a new blog article. This is the first time I have created a cover for an article instead of getting one online. I also solved some problems.</p><h2>Day 39 / Aug 29</h2><p>This day was completely focused on solving problems. I did more than I usually do, but nothing else.</p><h2>Day 40 / Aug 30</h2><p>Completed and published <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/jack-of-all-trades'>Jack of All Trades</a>.</p></main><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
