It hard to say "I used D3 for this" when there's HTML, CSS, non-D3 JavaScript, and SVG underneath.</p><h2>Visualizations</h2><p>Here are a bunch of pieces that represent milestones in this my two-week journey.</p><h3>Silly SVG face</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YiCftrk.png" alt="Silly SVG Face" /></p><p>That is probably the silliest thing you could do while learning "data visualization", except that its purpose was learning how to work with SVG. D3 (or probably all web-based data vis) is supposed to render SVG shapes. So, before working with actual data, it was a good idea to practice building shapes with SVG and making sure it is drawn with variables and a little math to make it pixel-perfect.</p><h3>Basic plots</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ryNSgyI.png" alt="Basic Plot" /></p><p>While this visually seems like a direct next step, much has been going on between that SVG face and this. There is a combination of React, D3, and vanilla JavaScript that I had to learn in order to build a bare bones bar chart or scatter plot.</p><ul><li><strong>D3</strong> has wide functionality like helper functions for data fetching, data  manipulation, and scales to map data ranges to pixel ranges.</li><li><strong>React</strong> is used to render and organize every visible element using the data  and D3 scales.</li><li>Vanilla <strong>JavaScript</strong> glues all that code together with logic for  conditionals, iteration, etc.</li></ul><h3>World map with points</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EzbRQtn.png" alt="World Map" /></p><p>This one was more heavy on D3 code, as D3 contains a lot of helper functions to draw parts of the map and set projections which affect the shape of the map.  I actually want to read and practice more with geo-spatial data and their visualization.</p><h3>Interactive scatter plot</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pVKYXl2.gif" alt="mtcars" /></p><p>This was the most complicated piece of work that I did in these two weeks. Beside the same stuff used in the simpler plots, the project also includes a third-party module for the drop-down menus. I also used some combined React+CSS logic to make that animated fade effect with the legend.</p><h2>Future plans</h2><p>I will, of course, continue with the lessons of Datavis 2020 as it gets updated. But there is this cool idea I have been thinking of for a while, which is to build a <i>slide deck</i> with this tech stack. I know there are different JavaScript libraries that make web-based presentations. All I need is to explore them and make data presentations.</p><hr/><p>Hope you enjoyed this colorful post... There is definitely more to come!</p></main><aside><pre id="logo"><code>(wipdev-blog)</code></pre><ul><li><a href="/">Home/About</a></li><li><a href="/posts">Articles</a></li></ul></aside><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
