(That's the one in the cover image above.)</p><h2>Day 11 / Aug 1</h2><p>Finished chapter 4 in <a href='https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/'>Clojure for the Brave and True</a>. There was a fun part at the end where I wrote a simple CSV parser with some exercises to add some functionality to it. Cool stuff!</p><h2>Day 12 / Aug 2</h2><p>Started chapter 5 of the book, which discusses the functional programming paradigm in more detail. Also, someone pointed me to a great source of documentation and a cheatsheet with links to that documentation. Things there are searchable in many ways and have lots of examples. A very cool discovery indeed!</p><p>Also, I started writing drafts for two articles.</p><h2>Day 13 / Aug 3</h2><p>Wrote a new overthinking article: <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/dependencyphobia'>Dependencyphobia</a>. Also messed around with random Clojure stuff.</p><h2>Day 14 / Aug 4</h2><p>Watched a couple of videos in the <a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI-mrGTUXmHXeKhy6UGdDxIKwM8L4MTbq'>Poetry of Programming</a> playlist where I learned about some new Clojure functions.</p><h2>Day 15 / Aug 5</h2><p>Finished chapter 5 of the book. Exercises at the end are great as always! Then, I jumped into chapter 6 and read a little bit. I also watched a couple of videos in the Poetry of Programming playlist. Almost done with that one.</p><h2>Day 16 / Aug 6</h2><p>Completed the Poetry of Programming playlist. Also, glanced through the book version of it as a kind of revision. It was a great overview of the basics of Clojure and functional programming.</p><h2>Day 17 / Aug 7</h2><p>I finally did it... My first Clojure app! It's a very simple SPA built with ClojureScript and Helix which is a React wrapper. You can see the code <a href='https://github.com/wip-dev/hello-cljs/'>here</a> or the deployed site <a href='https://hello-cljs.netlify.app/'>here</a>.</p><h2>Day 18 / Aug 8</h2><p>I have left writing for a couple of days now, so I got back to it and started drafting an article.</p><h2>Day 19 / Aug 9</h2><p>Completed and published an article: <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/programmers-are-rational-or-are-they'><strong>Programmers Are Rational â€” or Are They?</strong></a> Also, read a little in the book.</p><h2>Day 20 / Aug 10</h2><p>Finished chapter 6 in the book.</p></article></body></html>
