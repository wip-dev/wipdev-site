So, I wrote this article to publicly plan and document this challenge. Right now, I am thinking of doing (at least) two things as part of that challenge:</p><p>Write blog articles and learn, well... Clojure!</p><h2>Why Blog?</h2><p>You could read <a href='https://wipdev.hashnode.dev/what-got-me-here'>this article</a> where I ramble on about past steps in my tech journey and what led me to start this blog. To put it short here, I needed to have some creative freedom to break the relatively dull job routine, and blogging seemed to be a very easy idea to get started right away, especially with Hashnode.</p><p>I could use the blog to document my learnings, like this challenge here. I could also use it to share helpful stuff with the community or just pour my thoughts (actually overthinking) about any tech- or data-related topic that interests me.</p><h2>Why Clojure?</h2><p>Clojure, like any functional language, is very obscure. It's nowhere near JavaScript, Python, or even C/C++ in terms of popularity. So, why bother learning a language like that? Well, my friend...</p><p>First of all, I'm supposed to make this learning journey creative, so why not go weird and crazy with it? I mean it's not the craziest way to go, but it's crazy enough. Clojure is a Lisp-based, functional language, which should be a breath of fresh air given all the C-based, object-oriented languages we use.</p><p><em>(Side point: many people say that JS has FP because we do write functions and pass them to event handlers or high-order array methods, but others think it's kinda like the meme where mom says "We have FP at home." I'll hopefully form a solid opinion on that when I learn some Clojure.)</em></p><p>The second reason is that it's not completely new to me. I took some programming courses around 3-4 years ago on platforms like Coursera and edX. Two of my favorites were <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages'>Programming Languages Part A</a>, which taught FP basics using a language called Standard ML, and <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data'>How to Code - Simple Data</a>, which was using a Lisp language called Racket. Also, I did hack a little with Emacs Lisp for <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'>obvious reasons</a>.</p><p>So, I liked FP, and I liked Lisp. Clojure has both. That's it.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, that pretty much summarizes what I intend to do in this 100 Days of Code challenge. I wouldn't mind if other interesting stuff came up later, and I really hope the Clojure thing doesn't blow up in my face...</p><p>Let's go! ðŸš€</p></main><aside><pre id="logo"><code>(wipdev-blog)</code></pre><ul><li><a href="/">Home/About</a></li><li><a href="/posts">Articles</a></li></ul></aside><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
