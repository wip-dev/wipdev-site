The plot is built with JavaScript using the D3.js library and wrapped in a Shiny app.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This project was submitted to the Wonderful Wednesdays challenge hosted by PSI and reviewed by statisticians in the organization.

The square size isproportional to the sample size (i.e. weight) of that study.</li><li>A line for each confidence interval of the effect size in a  study.</li><li>Diamonds that represent the pooled estimate using either fixed-effect orrandom-effects model. The diamond width represents the confidence intervalaround the pooled estimate.</li><li>The plot is usually combined with the numbers.</li></ul><p>My own additions are:</p><ul><li>Colored bands to give a better visualization of the heterogeneity betweenstudies. There is a band for each study, and all are semi-transparent andoverlayed over each other so that more overlapping produces darker areas.</li><li>More attention to annotations than the typical plots, providing a title anda subtitle with the interventions and the outcome, respectively. Anotherlabel is also added to show which direction represents the "positive" effect.</li></ul><h2>App description</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OgcgIAX.png" alt="forest plot shiny" /></p><p>As a proof of concept for a viable product, I wrapped the plot in a Shiny app which provides additional interactive features.</p><ul><li>Selection of summary measure.</li><li>Control over the plot dimensions.</li><li>Help button that shows a guide for interpretation.</li></ul><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>Live version of the Shiny app: <a href='https://waseem-medhat.shinyapps.io/forest_plot_with_bands/'>https://waseem-medhat.shinyapps.io/forest&#95;plot&#95;with&#95;bands/</a></li><li>GitHub: <a href='https://github.com/waseem-medhat/forest_plot_with_bands'>https://github.com/waseem-medhat/forest&#95;plot&#95;with&#95;bands</a></li><li>Wonderful Wednesdays December submissions: <a href='https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-03-wonderful-wednesdays-december-2020/'>https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-03-wonderful-wednesdays-december-2020/</a></li></ul></main><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
