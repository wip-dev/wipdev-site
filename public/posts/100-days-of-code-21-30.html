I was able to stay at it every day of the 30.</p><p>I got a bit more familiar with the Clojure standard library, made <a href='https://wipdev.netlify.app/'>my own separate site</a> with it, and started dabbling with macros, which is the newest thing to me so far. I am getting more and more fascinated with Clojure in terms of its standard library - it lets you do so much with just functions and simple data structures, and you do it in a really concise and elegant way. Also, I am keeping a steady rate of writing articles.</p><p>Where am I going with this? I have no idea. Maybe I'll overthink about it in a future blog.</p><h2>Day 21 / 11 Aug</h2><p>I will try to develop a blog using Clojure. So, I started to search around for a Clojure-based static site generator. My current decision is to start with something minimal, which is just a Markdown parser instead of a full SSG boilerplate. I'll write the base HTML and CSS myself and use Clojure to convert Markdown to HTML. I'll also use ClojureScript if I need any JS (I may not).</p><p>I also started writing an article draft.</p><h2>Day 22 / 12 Aug</h2><p>Read chapter 7 in the <a href='https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/'>book</a>. Also, laid the foundation for my blog and wrote a little in an article draft.</p><h2>Day 23 / 13 Aug</h2><p>Started reading chapter 8 in the book. Then, I started writing some Clojure for the blog. I discovered some limitations in the raw Markdown parsing approach and start gradually patching them up.</p><h2>Day 24 / 14 Aug</h2><p>My blog is now almost complete! I successfully migrated the completed blog articles on Hashnode to the Clojure project. I also added articles from my old blogs and did the necessary editing to be compatible with the Markdown parser.</p><h2>Day 25 / 15 Aug</h2><p>I completed and published a Clojure vs JS article: <a href='https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/functional-programming'>Functional Programming</a> and made a near-complete version of my blog.</p><h2>Day 26 / 16 Aug</h2><p>Worked more on the blog to make it more presentable in terms of the home page and content listing. It is now hosted at <a href='https://wipdev.netlify.app/'>https://wipdev.netlify.app/</a></p><h2>Day 27 / 17 Aug</h2><p>There were some minor content edits I needed to do on the blog's home page. I also got back to reading the book because I left it for a couple of days now.</p><h2>Day 28 / 18 Aug</h2><p>I started writing a new blog article. Then, I discovered <a href='https://exercism.org/'>Exercism</a>, which seems like a nice place to practice Clojure. So, I did a couple of them.</p><h2>Day 29 / 19 Aug</h2><p>Completed and published <a href='https://wipdev.netlify.app/posts/collaboration-on-github'>Collaboration on GitHub: a Practical Intro</a>. Also, I did some problems in Exercism.</p><h2>Day 30 / 20 Aug</h2><p>Finished chapter 8 of the book and did a problem in Exercism.</p></main><aside><pre id="logo"><code>(wipdev-blog)</code></pre><ul><li><a href="/">Home/About</a></li><li><a href="/posts">Articles</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/wipdev-tech" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li></ul></aside><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
