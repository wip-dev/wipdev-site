The former would easily switch to a code-free tool if it is easier for the job. But the latter gets obsessed with languages, syntax, style, efficiency &ndash; things that are not always directly related to solving a domain problem.</p><blockquote><p> <i>Which style is better?</i> </p></blockquote><p>The answer is <i>it depends...</i> (When is it not?) But here is some food for thought about these programming approaches, mostly in the context of statistical analysis and/or data science.</p><h2>Actually, it is a continuum</h2><p>You might categorize these approaches in a binary fashion, but they are better thought of as opposite extremes of a continuous scale. On one end lie the purely get-it-done guys. On the other end, there are the coding nerds.  With that in mind, you'd find out that most people lie somewhere in the middle and never at the extremes.</p><h3>The practical extreme</h3><p>Here are people who put the domain problem above all else. Don't worry too much about code and just solve the problem. You can even ditch coding altogether and use Excel or a GUI-based statistical package.</p><p>The keyword here is "practicality", and there isn't much else to say. If it gives you the solution, it is good enough. You wouldn't want to waste time worrying about whether or not you put spaces or how long your lines of code are. You copied and pasted code multiple times? Fine. Wrote a <code>for</code> loop? Fine. Code took a couple of minutes to run? Okay.</p><h3>The optimal extreme</h3><p>Jumping right away to the other side, where code is the center of attention. Writing <code>for</code> loops is a big no-no: use <code>purrr::map&#40;&#41;</code> or <code>apply&#40;&#41;</code>. Refactor long pieces with clever tricks to make your code concise. A line must never be more than 80 characters long, and always start a new line after <code>%&gt;%</code>. Needless to say, graphical interfaces are the evil banes of performance and reproducibility. They are not even an option!</p><p>People argue against optimizing code, but no! Code must be efficient, reusable, and readable. You don't want to come 5 days later and start deciphering gibberish. Concise code is usually more readable. Elegant code is its own reward! And the seconds (or even milliseconds) you save after optimizing the code will add up if the code is rerun a lot.</p><h2>Why neither is right</h2><p>Going all-in on one side means that you give up the advantages of the other. If you focus on solving problems, that's perfectly fine. But you might find bottlenecks in your process, like a slow piece of code or too much duplication. On the other hand, the term "over-engineering" exists for a reason: focusing too much on code speed or conciseness might waste time or make the code inaccessible to others, because sometimes clever tricks are obscure.</p><h2>Moral of the story</h2><p>Simply put, if you find yourself gravitating towards any of the two extremes, try to pull yourself towards the middle. Strive to get the best of both worlds. But sometimes, the current situation will need something specific. Tight deadlines need getting things done, and massive data might force you into being smart with code.</p><hr/><p>P.S. I often fall into the optimizing extreme. But at the day of writing this post, I wrote a suboptimal regex in an exercise that solves the example string but won't generalize to other cases. In an attempt to avoid over-engineering, I tried to convince myself that passing the exercise is more than enough and I should move on...</p></main><aside><pre><code>(wipdev-blog)</code></pre><ul><li><a href="/">Home/About</a></li><li><a href="/posts">Articles</a></li></ul></aside><script src="/main.js"></script></body></html>
